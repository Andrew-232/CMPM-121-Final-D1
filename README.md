# CMPM 121 D1 Project

I looked at https://github.com/jellyb3e/cmpm-121-f25-d1-juliamanou repository and checked their commit history to where I think I would've found this change at. After I found it I made a similar change using their style to see if it would now display my own images.

I also looked at https://github.com/dfang10/Incremental-Demo-1-Fixed demo and liked how their game had a gradient background so I made mine have a gradient background as well.
